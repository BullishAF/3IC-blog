Most bitcoin maxi’s claim bitcoin should be the only coin labeled as a commodity and everything else is a security. Even the SEC(Securities and Exchange Commission) and CFTC(Commidity Futures Trading Commission) disagree as the SEC seems to lean towards bitcoin maxi’s way of thinking, but the CFTC had stated that Ethereum is also a commodity which means most other coins that are used as gas to power transactions on those blockchains are as well.

Just like buying gasoline for cars if you want to drive, you must buy ETH, BNB, SOL, AVAX, MATIC etc…to use these blockchains. These blockchains also use a proof-of-stake consensus in which validators can stake these coins to validate transactions and earn fees. Blockchains clearly aren’t companies they are comparable to cloud computing infrastructure such as AWS, Google Cloud etc…which you buy computing power or storage. The GB’s and TB’s computing units they sell aren’t securities so ETH or SOL blockchain units shouldn’t be any different.

NFTs and DeFi tokens aren’t as clearcut but NFTs are digital collectibles that can be things like artwork, trading cards, memberships and sports/concert tickets, they are clearly not securities imo. DeFi tokens are probably the most at risk of being labeled as a security. Most DeFi tokens are issued by DAO’s and used as voting power for decisions such as the fees on DEX’s like Uniswap(UNI token) and Sushiswap(SUSHI token) or the collateral approved on lending dapps like Compound(COMP token) and Aave(AAVE token).

The first argument is probably why is a DAO not a company and who gets to decide that. The second argument would be why are the tokens that grant you voting rights any different from shares that do the same, no matter if a company or a DAO issues them. You also have the issue of if tokens were sold, airdropped or farmed? If they were airdropped or farmed then at least the argument can be made that the tokens weren’t “sold” and after they were issued if market was created for the token was beyond your control. DeFi tokens that were outright sold will probably be the most at-risk of being labeled as a security.

With all that said, I think think the “securities law” in the US is complete bullshit and has mostly been used as a gate-keeping mechanism that has allowed the rich to get richer. Investors do need some level of protection but anything you invest in comes with a risk, whether that’s cryptocurrency, nfts or stocks. I personally think doing your own research, using common sense and not investing any money you can’t afford to lose is the better approach to just letting government agencies tell you what is or isn’t ok to invest in.
