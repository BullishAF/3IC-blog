A lot of people are upset that Sam Bankman-Fried was allowed to post bail after he was extradited back the to the US. First off, let me be *clear* that I didn't lose *that* much money in FTX mostly because I was already pretty fucking rekt'd from the Luna/UST/Three Arrows Capital collapse earlier in the year. For people that lost massive amounts of money in FTX, I'm sure they feel strongly about seeing SBF pay the price and suffer consequences and rightfully so. Now back to SBF posting bail, the judge set his bail at [250 Million Dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-to-be-released-on-250-million-bail.html) which is one of the largest bail amounts ever set in US history. 

A lot of people were initially so upset because they thought he actually *paid* the full $250 million to get out, which is *NOT* how bail bonds work. Usually the requirement is to pay 10% of the total amount set, which would have still been $25 million. Now his parents did put their home equity up as collateral which is reported to be valued at around $4 million, the rest seems to be an unsecured agreement based on "two individuals with *considerable assets*" who were willing to sign for SBF.

That means if he tries to flee and skip out on his bail, those two people can be held responsible for the $250 million. The judge also added several stipulations in his bond agreement and if he violates any of these, the judge can have his bond revoked.

> - **He is required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet**

> - **Submit to mental health and substance abuse counseling**

> - **Travel is resctricted to within and between the Northern District of California and the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York**

> - **Barred from opening any new lines of credit of more than $1,000 while he awaits trial**  

 
So obviously he didn't pay anything near $25 million, much less the full $250 million and basically was a way for the government to gain huge leverage by setting it that high. It's still an insane number when you compare it to recent bail amounts involving fraud cases such as Bernie Madoff. 

> - **Sam Bankman-Fried(FTX) - *Bond Amount $250 Million*. *Allegedly* misused $8 Billion Dollars of customer funds from his exchange.**

> - **Bernie Madoff(Madoff Investments) - *Bond Amount $10 Million*. Ran a Ponzi scheme for decades causing investors to lose more than $64 Billion Dollars. Sentenced to 150 years in prison.**

> - **Bernard Ebbers(Worldcom) -  *Bond Amount $10 Million*. Used fraudulent accounting practices which led to losses of $11 Billion Dollars. Sentenced to 25 years in prison.**

> - **Jeffery Skilling(Enron) - *Bond Amount - $5 Million*. Estimated losses of $74 Billion Dollars by using fraudulent accounting practices, eventually leading to the collapse and bankruptcy of Enron. Sentenced to 14 years in prison.**

So going by these numbers, SBF actually has the lowest dollar amount in losses but yet somehow his bail was set 10x higher than the other three men **combined**. Which also leads me to my next point, many people seem to be of the opinion SBF could be facing life in prison if convicted on all charges. I think that would be too harsh of a sentence and is not realistic. 

The reason they threw the book at Madoff was that it was a literal ponzi scheme, using new investors money to pay out old investors. Enron and Worldcom was more "operational and accounting failures" which is similiar to what happened with FTX. So I think Sam *if found guilty* probably gets somewhere between 15-25 years.
