If you care anything about the freedom and privacy of your money then Bitcoin or Crypto shouldn't be considered "dumb" or "useless". In fact, they are in the beginning stages of a battle against Governments, Banks and Companies over the freedom and privacy of money. First, let's look at CBDC's and how Governments around the world will use them. **Central Bank Digital Currencies** are electronic coins or tokens controlled and backed by the government. Some Countries already have them and eventually *every* Country will have them [CBDC Tracker](https://cbdctracker.org/). 

You may be thinking "what's the big deal, this isn't much different than the USD balance in my banking app now". In reality, it's **A LOT** different because CBDC's will allow governments to implement **social credit systems**, **eliminate the use of physical cash** and give it **full control and traceabilty** of the entire financial system, allowing them to decide **when, where and how** a citizen can spend money. And make no mistake that governments, banks and even some companies want nothing more than to track and control everyone's money. Need some proof of where things are headed? üëá

I could go further down the CBDC rabbit hole on why it's such a horrible idea but instead here's another link on CBDCs, if you want to read more into it

Does the government tracking every penny you spend, deciding when, where and how much you can spend, sound like a world you want to live in? If not, then you will probably be thankful that Bitcoin/Crypto exist and can now start to understand their importance in fighting to retain the freedom of **money**. Let's also be clear that I mean Bitcoin/Crypto that **you actually own and control with a private key**. Holding Bitcoin or Crypto on centalized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase or apps like Cashapp or Paypal are just numbers showing in your account but **you aren't actually in control of that Bitcoin or Crypto**. 

If any of those companies or the government wanted to take it or tell you how to use it (or steal it like Sam Bankman-Fried did with FTX) then they can, because **those companies are actually in control of that Bitcoin/Crypto**. If you want to actually own and be in contol of your Bitcoin and Crypto you need to use a **self-custodial wallet**. A self-custodial wallet means **you are in possesion of the private key** for that wallet. If you're interested in having a self-custodial wallet here a few suggestions 

You can get a hardware wallet which is a physical device similiar to a usb stick 
* [Ledger Nano - Hardware Wallet](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-s-plus/?r=c06d)

You can get self-custodial software wallets which gives you access to your private keys by using a *mnemonic or seed phrase* which you **must write down and store in a safe, secure place and NEVER show it or give it to anyone**
* [Metamask Wallet - A  self custodial wallet that works on blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain](https://metamask.io/)
* [Phantom Wallet - A self-custodial wallet that works on the Solana Blockchain](https://phantom.app/)
* [Trust Wallet - A self-custodial wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum and many other Cryptocurrencies](https://trustwallet.com/)

I personally think the freedom and privacy of people's money that they work hard for matters, much like freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. If you feel the same, then it's probably a good idea to learn and read up on Bitcoin and Crypto.
