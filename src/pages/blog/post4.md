Since Elon paid a whopping **$44 Billion** to purchase Twitter and take it private again, he has clearly put in a lot of effort to implement positive changes on the platform like working to eliminate bots which is a huge problem, rolling out the [Twitter Blue Paid Subscription](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue) to generate revenue and also releasing the [Twitter Files](https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394) which were internal documents showing how Twitter executives communicated with the government on topics such as shadow-bans and misinformation. For all the good things Elon has tried to do so far, over the last week or so he's now made several controversial decisions. 

Banning the "Elon Jet" account which tracks his flight data and announcing anyone doxing real-time locations will be suspended seems *somewhat* understandable, no one wants to be tracked or be put in danger by being tracked. The bigger issues are the suspension of several journalists who simply questioned the ban and then yesterday announcing a new policy which bans users from posting links to others social media platforms.

He quickly reversed course on that policy and also announced there would be a "vote" on major policy changes going forward then shortly afterwards making a poll on whether he should step down as "head of Twitter". No one is really sure just how serious Elon is about "stepping down" but he has received backlash from Tesla shareholders recently about the time he's spending working on Twitter versus Tesla and he did say he would be looking for someone to run the day-to-day operations when he initially bought Twitter. Several people quickly offered to "run" Twitter such as [Lex Friedman](https://twitter.com/lexfridman/status/1604624131626090497). Regardless of whether Elon steps down, there is clearly a need for a more censorship resistant social media platform some alternatives so far   
- **[Nostr](https://nostr.com/)** 
- **[Minds](https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/subscriptions/latest)** which runs a Nostr relay and seems pretty good
- **[Lens](https://www.lens.xyz/)** which is being built on Polygon Blockchain but so far is just a "boys club" of people "eligible for a .lens name" ðŸ™„
- **[Solcial](https://solcial.io/onboarding/log-in)** which is still in "invite-only" mode and you have to email to request an invite ðŸ™„

Maybe Elon can find someone to take over, get things in-order and keep improving the platform, if not both Twitter and a large portion of Elon's net worth may implode and that is not going to be a pretty site to see.
