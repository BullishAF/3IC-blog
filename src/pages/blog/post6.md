It was Elon Musk who once said "Who controls the memes, contols the universe". I had the thought recently that for crypto, that most likely means "Who controls the memecoins, controls the metaverse". First lets discuss memes, a meme is a powerful tool, most people just think of "internet memes" but *memetics* is the study of information and culture based on how humans use memes. 

But what even is a meme anyway? Well, the term "meme" was first coined by biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book 'The Selfish Gene'. 
Analogous to a human "gene" that is reproduced and can be passed on, the "meme" was conceived as a "unit of culture" (an idea, belief, pattern of behavior, etc.) which is "hosted" in the minds of one or more individuals, and can reproduce itself in the sense of jumping from the mind of one person to the mind of another. 

Just as it is for a gene, a memes success is based on it's contribution to the effectiveness of its host. A weak meme will die out quickly, while a strong meme will replicate and continue to be passed on and survive. Basically the overall concept is human beings want to copy, replicate and mimic other human beings, because thats human nature, so strong memes will continue to survive.

Now take the same concept with memes(memetics), add a coin/token/"unit of account"(crypto) that can be actively traded and a global, instant communication platform(twitter) and things get pretty interesting when these three things come together, that is basically the ingredients of what makes a "memecoin". 

If a "memes" power comes from the ability to be able quickly replicate information, ideas or beliefs across humans beings, then the "memecoins" power comes from the ability to literally "meme" itself into a coin/token with value by using twitter to replicate and quickly form consensus among a small group of people that the coin/token does have a value. 

If that small group knows how to use memes and fomo(fear of missing out) to it's advantage on twitter, it can rapidly grow into an ever larger group, with the memecoin also rapidly going up in value. It is actually pretty fun and you can almost feel when everything begins to sync. The group begins to grow, the coin price is quickly rising and the group starts is using memes as a way to try to grab attention on twitter.

The beauty in all of this of course, is that everyone who chooses to get involved in a memecoin like this is fully aware that it's a memecoin, so no one is being "pitched" on a buying it or *should* have any expectation for it to reach a certain price. Most people go into it knowing the most **likely** scenario is you will buy it, the hype will die, the coin price will tank and you will lose money. 

Memecoins are still a pretty new concept but watching people take culture(meme), value(coin) and communications(twitter/social media) and merge it into something totally new is fascinating.
