AI and chatGPT, the new "buzzwords" feel like they're being slapped on every project and Twitter is flooded with discussions around AI. One thing is for sure it isn't just a new tech "buzzword" like "Web3" from recently or those before like "Blockchain", "Cloud Computing" and "IOT", this is full blown mania not just in the tech sector or media but everywhere.

Projects with the AI or chatGPT words are everywhere on Product Hunt, AI has become the hottest discussion on Twitter(except for maybe the the lab leaks) and even the Federal Trade Commission(FTC) released a [statement](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/ftc-AI-warning-OpenAI-ChatGPT-advertising/643739/) warning companies about abusing the "AI hype" in advertising.

Reports are also saying that Elon Musk is looking into starting an alternative to ChatGPT which won't be ....."woke"(Surely one more company on his already stacked plate won't hurt). 

The crazy and/or scary part is that this is considered the "early" stages in the AI sector but that also means however long this initial AI mania lasts, it should eventually die down. This initial AI buzz has made it clear though that **everyone** is aware at least to some degree, that AI will have huge implicattions on our society.
