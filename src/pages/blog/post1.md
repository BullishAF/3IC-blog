The Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX downfall comes down to a few key decisions. It was a terrible idea to own a crypto exchange holding user funds worth billions of dollars, while also owning(but claiming to not be actively involved) with his trading firm Alameda Research, in addition to that they also had a venture arm FTX Ventures that was making very risky bets on new crypto start-ups. So when Alameda Research lost massive amounts of money, most likely from the Luna/3AC debacle, SBF reportedly sent Alameda up to $4 Billion evidently obtained by using FTT, Serum and other tokens as collateral then finally dipping into customer assets deposited on FTX.

As a result of those decisions, FTX is now facing a massive hole of $10+ Billion. So it’s crucial that we find solutions to make sure centralized exchanges are being transparent and held accountable with user assets they hold. CZ the CEO of Binance has asked for all centralized exchanges to use merkle trees and publish on-chain proof-of-reserves and for now that is the least we should do as we move toward more transparency.

In my opinion the “ideal” scenario would probably be something where “centralized exchanges” eventually become more of a regulated fiat on/off ramp that would handle the KYC rules, the swaps to/from crypto & then users would exit to an on-chain non-custodial wallet. It could minimize the amount of crypto centralized exchanges need to hold since they would just need to hold the amount to make swaps from fiat to crypto. The problem with this kind of solution is that any CEO of a centralized exchange is not going to be ok with outright eliminating trading on their platform. Although they would still make be able to make money by charging for fiat to crypto conversions, it’s likely to pale in comparison to the fees they generate from trades.

Another problem is it’s really hard to build an exchange fully on-chain and they do not perform nearly as well as a centralized exchange. Between paying gas fees and having to wait for the tx to confirm on the blockchain, market-makers and serious traders who take things like latency very serious will continue to prefer using a centralized exchange. As of now, most decentralized exchanges on-chain are based off of Uniswap which requires pooling liquidity in 50/50 pools and can result in impermanent loss which is to say that providing liquidity to a DEX can result in a net loss . 

The last big hurdle with moving fully on-chain is using “non-custodial” wallets like Metamask. Most people find it easier and ironically think it’s “safer” to use a centralized exchange versus having to be responsible for their private key and using smart contracts but there are solutions such as abstracting the private key away with smart contract wallets like Argent and even though we are trending toward moving fully on-chain over the long-term and the tech to allow that will continue to get better over the next several years, centralized exchanges will continue to hold massive amounts of crypto and will remain a huge risk so we need measures in place where user funds can’t be misused.
